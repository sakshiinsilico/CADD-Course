Weeks 1–3: Foundations of Drug Discovery (NPTEL – IIT Madras)

This section summarizes the foundational concepts covered in Weeks 1 to 3 of the NPTEL course *Computer-Aided Drug Design* by Dr. Mukesh Doble (IIT Madras). These lectures focus on the theoretical framework necessary before applying computational tools in drug design.



 Week 1: Introduction to Drug Discovery
- Drug discovery pipeline: Target identification → Lead discovery → Optimization
- Importance of selectivity and minimizing toxicity
- Oral administration and barriers (enzymes, acidity, membrane absorption)
- ADME: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion
- Bioavailability: How much drug actually reaches the target site



  Week 2: Structure and Property
- Chemical properties affecting drug action: solubility, stability, pKa, logP
- Structural traits of top-selling drugs
- Importance of molecular size, charge, and hydrogen bonding in drug design



  Week 3: ADME Rules
- Lipinski's Rule of Five and drug-likeness filters
- Predicting oral bioavailability and toxicity
- Role of blood-brain barrier and metabolic stability
- Significance of computational filters before docking/QSAR



  These foundational weeks lay the groundwork for applying machine learning, docking, and molecular modeling in later modules.
